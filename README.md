# Luma Technical Interview - QA Automation

## Problem Definition
As our platform grows we are constantly looking for better ways to test, find and fix bugs.
This is a straightforward assessment where we would like to see your ability to create an automated test.

## Interview Task
We would like your automated tests to perform two simple tasks:
- Login to our staging Environment
- Create a Patient Referral - refer to this video to see how to create a patient referral - https://youtu.be/Q29KbOBKOVc
You will find below the necessary credentials to perform this test.
It's part of your assessment to investigate about the product and figure out how to create a Patient Referral.
